# Keycloak For TUJ Projects

## Purpose

This is a Keycloak server for TUJ user authentication, including professors, staff, and etc. This might eventually manage students as well.
As discussed Prof. Hani, OSS authentication systems are preferred for internal system integration; we decided to use Keycloak.

## How to Run

Run this command on terminal

```
docker-compose up
```
